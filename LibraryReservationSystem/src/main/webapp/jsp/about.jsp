    <h2>About Our Library System</h2>
    <p>
        This Library Management System is designed to streamline the process of reserving and managing books 
        for both students and administrators. Developed as part of an academic coursework project, it demonstrates
        a complete Java EE-based web application with authentication, role-based access, reporting, and more.
    </p>
    <p>
        The system is built using JSP, Servlets, JDBC, and MySQL, following the MVC architecture pattern. 
        It reflects real-world practices for handling library operations in an educational institution.
